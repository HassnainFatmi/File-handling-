# File-handling-
This repository contains codes related to writing and reading data from a file disk
this is done by using two derived classes: ofstream (for writing data) and ifstream (for reading data) from a main class fstream whose header is included above the main function
Moreover, getline() function from the <string> library is used for reading a whole line from the disk file.
Its prototype is void getline(file reading object name,string);
